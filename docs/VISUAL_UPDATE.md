# Visual Redesign & Next Stage Feature 🎨

I have successfully implemented a complete visual overhaul and the requested "Next Stage" button!

## 1. Modern Glassmorphic UI 💎
The Game Screen has been completely redesigned with a modern, "Glassmorphism" aesthetic:
- **Floating Panels**: The Status Bar and Controls now float over the board with a blurred glass effect.
- **Gradient Backgrounds**: A subtle, beautiful gradient replaces the valid background.
- **Clean Typography**: Improved font weights and spacing.
- **Glass Buttons**: New icon buttons with frosted glass backgrounds.

## 2. "Next Stage" Button 🏆
- **Victory Screen**: When you win a stage, you will now see a **"Next Stage →"** button!
- **Gradient Style**: The button features a blue-to-purple gradient to stand out.
- **Logic**: It only appears if there is a next stage available.

## 3. Improved Layout 📱
- **Responsive**: The layout handles varied screen sizes better with the `Stack` approach.
- **Move History**: Now accessible via a clean "History" button in the top right, opening a bottom sheet (mobile-friendly).
- **Controls**: Undo, Hint, and Restart are cleanly organized in a floating bottom bar.

## 4. How to Test
1. **Play a Game**: Complete any stage (e.g., Stage 1).
2. **Win**: Upon victory, the "Next Stage" button will appear.
3. **Click It**: You will instantly transition to the next level!

## Next Steps (Multiplayer) 🤝
I have prepared the groundwork for the "Play with Friend" feature. Since you connected connected Supabase, we can build the Realtime Multiplayer logic next!

The app is running with the new design now! 🚀
